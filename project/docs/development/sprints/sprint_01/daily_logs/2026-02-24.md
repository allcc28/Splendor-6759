# Daily Log - February 24, 2026

**Sprint**: Sprint 1  
**Team Members Present**: Yehao Yan  
**Hours Worked**: ~2 hours

---

## What We Accomplished Today

1. ✅ Completed project structure and workflow setup
2. ✅ Created comprehensive agile documentation system
3. ✅ Researched Score-based agent design approaches
4. ✅ Analyzed PPO convergence feasibility with sparse rewards
5. ✅ **Configured WSL2 + GPU environment**
6. ✅ **Verified RTX 4090 GPU working with CUDA 12.1**

## Key Decisions / Insights

### Score-Based Agent Design Research
- Identified 3 potential approaches: Naive, Win Bonus, Progress Hints
- Naive approach likely won't converge (demonstrates problem well)
- Win bonus helps but still sparse
- Tiny progress hints may be needed for practical baseline

### PPO for Sparse Rewards
- PPO can handle sparse rewards but requires extensive exploration
- Estimated 10k-20k episodes for convergence (~12-24 hours)
- May need exploration bonuses (entropy, epsilon-greedy)

### WSL2 Environment Setup ✅
- Successfully installed Miniconda in WSL2
- PyTorch 2.5.1 + CUDA 12.1 working perfectly
- GPU verified: RTX 4090 with 25.76 GB memory
- All dependencies installed and tested
- Splendor environment runs flawlessly

## Plan for Tomorrow

1. ~~Make DQN vs PPO decision (create ADR)~~ ✅ Done
2. ~~Decide on score-based reward variant (create ADR)~~ Research complete
3. Start implementing state representation module (Phase 2, Task 2.1)
4. Implement state vectorizer (Phase 2, Task 2.2)
5. Create Gym wrapper for SB3 (Phase 3, Task 3.1)

## Notes

- Found that existing evaluators can be adapted for rewards
- Legacy code provides good examples of tournament setup
- Need to verify GPU environment before training experiments
