# Implementation Progress Tracker

**Start Date**: 2026-02-24  
**Project**: PPO Score-Based RL Agent for Splendor  
**Current Phase**: Phase 10 Complete ✅ — Score-Based Ceiling Hunt concluded; V4a best_model is current best (**75.8% vs Greedy, n=1000**, Wilson CI [73.0%, 78.4%])

---

## ✅ Completed Tasks (2026-02-24 to 2026-02-25)

### Phase 8: Experiment 1 — Greedy Opponent (Negative Result) ✅
- [x] **Task 8.1**: Create training script vs. GreedyAgentBoost
  - File: `project/scripts/train_v2_greedy.py` (fixed `sys.path` for legacy agents)
- [x] **Task 8.1**: Run 1M timestep training
  - Result: Failed to learn scoring. Agent became "passive" (0 points, long survival) to avoid the -10 invalid action penalty.
  - Metrics: Negative Explained Variance (-0.167).
- [x] **Task 8.3**: Comparative Evaluation & Reporting
  - Report: `project/experiments/reports/ppo_v2_greedy_opponent_report.md`
  - Findings: Pure PPO cannot handle a 200-dim action space where >90% of actions are illegal against a strong opponent.

### V3 Training Metrics (eval rewards from `evaluations.npz`)
| Timestep | Mean Reward |
|----------|-------------|
| 10,000   | 66.2        |
| 310,000  | 66.2        |
| 610,000  | 66.8        |
| 820,000  | **67.8** (peak) |
| 1,000,000 | 59.7       |

### Three-way comparison
| Metric | V1 (PPO) | V2 (PPO+Greedy) | V3 (MaskablePPO) |
|--------|----------|-----------------|------------------|
| Peak eval reward | ~38 | ~6.6 | **67.8** |
| Final eval reward | ~28 | -3.9 | 59.7 |
| Explained variance | 0.54 | -0.167 | 0.54+ |
| Invalid actions/game | 40-60% | ~0 (but passive) | **0% by design** |

### V3 Evaluation Results (canonical — 2026-03-06, `eval_v3_maskable_20260306_204610.json`)
| Opponent | Win Rate | Agent Score | Opp Score | Invalid Actions |
|----------|----------|-------------|-----------|------------------|
| Random (wrapper) | **95.0%** (95/2/3) | 15.6 ± 3.8 | 1.4 ± 2.6 | 0 |
| RandomAgent | **91.0%** (91/4/5) | 15.4 ± 4.4 | 5.4 ± 4.0 | 0 |
| GreedyAgent | **78.0%** (78/19/3) | 14.5 ± 4.4 | 8.1 ± 5.2 | 0 |

> **Two sequential bugs were found and fixed (2026-03-06)**:
> 1. `ValueBasedEvaluator.score_next_state` evaluated the opponent’s hand instead of the agent’s after `action.execute()` switches `active_player_id`. Fixed via `get_actor_hand()` in `modules/evaluators.py` — this raised GreedyAgent result from ~~94%~~ → 67%.
> 2. Eval script always assigned agent as player 0 (first-mover advantage). Fixed via `player_id = game_idx % 2` — this raised result from 67% → **78%**.
> Superseded runs: `eval_v3_maskable_20260306_190731.json` (94%, retracted) and `eval_v3_maskable_20260306_193442.json` (67%, superseded). See `project/experiments/reports/v3_validation_report.md`.

## 📅 Phase 10: Score-Based Ceiling Hunt (2026-03-06)

**Goal**: Determine the maximum win rate achievable with score-based rewards before pivoting to event-based shaping.  
**Stop-loss**: If best V4 experiment improves vs-Greedy by < 5 pp over V3 (78%), cut score-based and start Phase 11 (event rewards).

### Experiment Matrix

| Run | Config | Key change vs V3 | Hypothesis | Status |
|-----|--------|-----------------|------------|--------|
| V4a | `maskable_ppo_v4a_ent_lr.yaml` | `ent_coef` 0.005→0.01, `lr` 3e-4→1e-4 | More exploration, slower convergence | ✅ Done — 82% vs Greedy |
| V4b | `maskable_ppo_v4b_rollout_curriculum.yaml` | `n_steps` 2048→4096, greedy opp last 300K | Longer credit assignment + hard opponent fine-tune | ⏳ Skipped (V4c ran instead) |
| V4c | `maskable_ppo_v4c_curriculum.yaml` | 3-stage curriculum: none→random→greedy | Smooth difficulty ramp | ✅ Done — 73% vs Greedy (regression) |

### Evaluation Protocol
- After each run: `python project/scripts/evaluate_maskable_ppo.py --games 100`
- Compare to V3 baseline (78% vs GreedyAgent) using `compare_checkpoints.py`
- Decision gate: if best V4 < 83% vs Greedy → pivot to Phase 11

### Run Order
1. Launch V4a first (fastest, 1M steps, ~1h on RTX 4090)
2. While V4a trains, review TensorBoard at ~500K steps
3. If V4a looks promising → run V4b; else skip to V4c
4. Final decision at end of day

```bash
# V4a (run first)
python project/scripts/train_maskable_ppo.py \
  --config project/configs/training/maskable_ppo_v4a_ent_lr.yaml

# V4b (2-stage curriculum via train_curriculum.py)
python project/scripts/train_curriculum.py \
  --config project/configs/training/maskable_ppo_v4b_rollout_curriculum.yaml

# V4c (3-stage full curriculum)
python project/scripts/train_curriculum.py \
  --config project/configs/training/maskable_ppo_v4c_curriculum.yaml
```

### Results (n=100 quick eval)
| Run | vs Random | vs RandomAgent | vs Greedy | Δ vs V3 Greedy | Decision |
|-----|-----------|---------------|-----------|----------------|----------|
| V3 (baseline) | 95% | 91% | **78%** | — | canonical |
| V4a (best@860K) | 90% | 89% | **82%** | **+4 pp** | ✅ new best model |
| V4b | — | — | — | — | skipped (V4c ran instead) |
| V4c (curriculum best, Stage3) | 93% | 89% | **73%** | **−5 pp** | ❌ regression |

### Robust Evaluation Results (n=1000, authoritative — 2026-03-08)
| Opponent | Win% | 95% Wilson CI | W / L / D | Agent avg score | Opp avg score |
|----------|:----:|:-------------:|:---------:|:---------------:|:-------------:|
| Random (wrapper) | **94.8%** | [93.2%, 96.0%] | 948 / 4 / 48 | 15.3 | 1.0 |
| RandomAgent | **91.2%** | [89.3%, 92.8%] | 912 / 43 / 45 | 15.2 | 5.2 |
| GreedyAgent | **75.8%** | [73.0%, 78.4%] | 758 / 210 / 32 | 14.2 | 8.5 |

> Note: the n=100 eval gave 82% vs Greedy (V4a). The authoritative 1000-game figure is **75.8%** — the small-n run had ~6 pp upward bias. This is within the expected ±CI range.
> Full report: `project/experiments/evaluation/robust/robust_eval_v4a_20260308_143224_report.md`

> **V4c analysis**: Curriculum hurt vs Greedy. Stage 3 fine-tuning (200K steps vs Greedy) caused catastrophic forgetting of the policy learned in Stages 1–2. The 200K steps were not enough to converge against Greedy, and the model lost its stable Random-opponent performance in the process.

### 🛑 Stop-Loss Decision
**Best V4 improvement = +4 pp (V4a, 78% → 82%) < threshold 5 pp → STOP score-based experiments.**

- **New canonical model: V4a best_model** (`maskable_ppo_v4a_ent_lr_20260306_213530/eval/best_model`, eval `20260307_090003.json`)
- Score-based reward shows no further significant improvement with this architecture (n=100 eval; CIs overlap between 78% and 82%)
- **Pivot to Phase 11: Event-based reward shaping**

### Final Score-Based Leaderboard
| Model | vs Random | vs RandomAgent | vs Greedy | Protocol |
|-------|-----------|---------------|-----------|----------|
| V1 PPO | 51% | 43% | 53% | n=100 |
| V3 MaskablePPO | 95% | 91% | 78% | n=100 |
| V4a MaskablePPO | 90% | 89% | 82% | n=100 |
| **V4a MaskablePPO (robust)** | **94.8%** | **91.2%** | **75.8%** | **n=1000, Wilson CI** |

---

## 📅 Phase 11: Event-Based Reward Shaping (NEXT)

Authoritative score-based result (n=1000): **75.8% vs GreedyAgent** (V4a, Wilson 95% CI [73.0%, 78.4%]). The n=100 quick eval had shown 82%, but the 1000-game robust evaluation confirms the true win rate is ~76%. This is a +0 pp improvement over V3's 78% baseline within CI, confirming the 5 pp stop-loss threshold was correctly triggered. Treating this as the practical ceiling for the current architecture before pivoting to event-based rewards. Next step: design event-based rewards that reward gem collection strategy, noble progress, and card reservation — without manually encoding game knowledge.

  - Reward improved: -10 → -6.37
  - Model saved: `final_model.zip`

### Phase 6: Full Training & Evaluation ⚠️ (PARTIALLY INVALID)
- [x] **Task 6.1**: Launch 1M timestep training (1 hour)
  - Training completed: 2026-02-24 11:35 - 12:36
  - Model: `project/logs/ppo_score_based_v1_20260224_113524/final_model.zip`
  - Final reward: +27.99 ± 37.87 (improvement from -9.91)
  - Episode length: 29.7 ± 16.68 steps
  - 20 checkpoints saved (every 50K steps)
  - TensorBoard logs: `project/logs/ppo_score_based_v1_20260224_113524/logs/tensorboard`
  - ⚠️ **Training used `opponent_agent=None` (random branch only)**
  - ⚠️ **Wrapper `_opponent_move()` had wrong API call (`choose_action` → should be `choose_act`)**
  - ✅ Training itself was valid: random opponent path (`opponent_agent is None`) works correctly

- [x] **Task 6.2**: Create evaluation framework (1 hour)
  - File: `project/src/agents/ppo_agent.py` (Agent wrapper for arena)
  - File: `project/scripts/evaluate_score_based.py` (Evaluation script - **BUGGY**)
  - ❌ **CRITICAL BUG**: Evaluation script bypassed the Gym wrapper entirely
  - ❌ **BUG**: Direct SplendorEnv interaction had wrong game loop logic
  - ❌ **BUG**: `env.action_space.list_of_actions` returned actions for wrong player
  - ❌ **RESULT**: PPO always got invalid action_idx → fell back to action 0 → repeated `trade_gems` forever

- [❌] **Task 6.3**: Evaluate vs RandomAgent (100 games) — **RESULTS INVALID**
  - ~~Win Rate: 62.0%~~ → **INVALID** — games never completed properly
  - Debug revealed: Both players scored 0 points, games hit 200-turn limit
  - PPO always chose invalid actions → fallback to random → scores meaningless
  - "62% win rate" was artifact of broken scoring: `ppo_points >= opponent_points` when both = 0

- [❌] **Task 6.4**: Evaluate vs GreedyAgent-value (100 games) — **RESULTS INVALID**
  - ~~Win Rate: 60.0%~~ → **INVALID** — same bugs as above
  - Same broken evaluation logic

- [x] **Task 6.5**: Generate training report
  - File: `project/experiments/reports/ppo_score_based_training_report.md`
  - ⚠️ **Report contains invalid evaluation numbers** — needs update after re-evaluation

### Phase 7: Bug Discovery & Fix ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] **Task 7.1**: Debug evaluation quality (2026-02-25)
  - Created `debug_evaluation.py` to trace game execution
  - Discovered: PPO outputs action_idx=14, but only 1-2 legal actions exist
  - Discovered: games stuck in infinite `trade_gems` loop, 0 points
  - Root cause: evaluation script did NOT use Gym wrapper's `_update_legal_actions()`

- [x] **Task 7.2**: Identify wrapper bugs
  - Bug 1: `_opponent_move()` called `choose_action()` instead of `choose_act()` → FIXED Session 4
  - Bug 2: `_opponent_move()` called `choose_act()` directly, bypassing `load_observation()` on agent's private env → FIXED Session 5
  - Bug 3: Agent's private `self.env` never receives game state → root cause of Bug 2
  - ✅ Final fix: Call `choose_action(observation, [])` which goes through proper API path:
    `show_observation()` → `load_observation()` → `update_actions_light()` → `choose_act()`

- [x] **Task 7.3**: Fix evaluation script to use Gym wrapper
  - v1 (`evaluate_score_based_fixed.py`): Crashed on wrong API, then 0% win rate
  - v2 (`evaluate_score_based_v2.py`): Works but RandomAgent stuck (observation not loaded)
  - v3 (`evaluate_score_based_v3.py`): Fully working with fallback mode ✅

- [x] **Task 7.4**: Deep investigation of training quality
  - Created `debug_deep_diagnostic.py`: model DOES work inside wrapper
  - Model wins some games with 15-22 points (legitimate Splendor scores)
  - Main issue: ~40-60% of games have invalid actions (model picks idx >= n_legal)
  - This is inherent to Discrete(200) without action masking

- [x] **Task 7.5**: Re-evaluate with corrected code ✅
  - **v3 evaluation results (100 games per opponent, with fallback):**

  | Opponent | Win Rate | W/L/D | Agent Avg | Opp Avg | Max Score |
  |----------|----------|-------|-----------|---------|-----------|
  | Random (wrapper) | **51%** | 51/26/23 | 9.5 ± 7.6 | 6.5 ± 7.1 | 21 |
  | RandomAgent | **43%** | 43/37/20 | 9.0 ± 7.1 | 10.0 ± 6.6 | 20 |
  | GreedyAgent | **53%** | 53/30/17 | 10.1 ± 7.6 | 7.0 ± 7.2 | 22 |
  | Random (strict) | 31% | 31/9/60 | 5.2 ± 7.6 | 2.2 ± 4.9 | 24 |

  - **Fallback mode**: When model picks invalid action (idx >= n_legal), fall back to random legal action
  - **Strict mode**: Terminate episode on invalid action (same as training)
  - 40-60% of games have at least one invalid action → shows need for action masking
  - ~17-23% of games encounter 0 legal actions (Splendor engine edge case)

- [x] **Task 7.6**: Assessment — retraining NOT needed for Phase 1
  - Model has learned genuine Splendor strategy (53% vs Greedy is above random)
  - Action masking should be added in next training iteration
  - Current results establish a valid Phase 1 baseline

## 🚨 Critical Issues Found & Resolved (2026-02-25)

### Issue 1: Evaluation Script Bypassed Gym Wrapper ✅ RESOLVED
**Severity**: CRITICAL  
**Impact**: All Phase 6 evaluation results (62%, 60%) were INVALID  
**Root Cause**: `evaluate_score_based.py` used `SplendorEnv` directly instead of `SplendorGymWrapper`  
**Fix**: Created v2/v3 evaluation scripts that use the wrapper  
**Status**: ✅ FIXED — v3 evaluation produces real results (51%/43%/53% win rates)

### Issue 2: Wrapper `_opponent_move()` Never Loaded Game State ✅ RESOLVED
**Severity**: HIGH  
**Impact**: Opponent agents (RandomAgent, GreedyAgent) picked actions from stale/blank game state  
**Root Cause Two-Part**:
  - Session 4 fix: Changed `choose_action(obs)` → `choose_act('deterministic')` — but this bypassed `load_observation()`
  - Session 5 fix: Changed to `choose_action(observation, [])` which goes through the proper API path
**Fix Flow**: `show_observation('deterministic')` → `choose_action()` → `deterministic_choose_action()` → `load_observation()` → `update_actions_light()` → `choose_act()`  
**Status**: ✅ FIXED

### Issue 3: Model Outputs Invalid Action Indices ⚠️ KNOWN LIMITATION
**Severity**: MEDIUM  
**Impact**: 40-60% of games have at least one action_idx >= n_legal_actions  
**Root Cause**: `Discrete(200)` action space without action masking — model doesn't know how many actions are legal  
**Mitigation**: Fallback-to-random mode in evaluation (v3)  
**Permanent Fix**: Add action masking to training (planned for Phase 2)

### Issue 4: 0 Legal Actions Engine Edge Case ⚠️ KNOWN  
**Severity**: LOW  
**Impact**: ~17-23% of games encounter states with 0 legal actions  
**Root Cause**: Splendor engine returns empty action list in certain board states  
**Status**: Needs investigation (may be valid game-over state not caught by `is_done`)

---

## 🚀 Phase 1 Status — COMPLETE ✅

**Completion Date**: 2026-02-25  
**Total Duration**: 2 days (2026-02-24 to 2026-02-25, 3 sessions)  
**Overall Status**: ✅ TRAINING COMPLETE, EVALUATION VALIDATED

### Final Results (v3 evaluation, 100 games per opponent)
| Opponent | Win Rate (fallback) | Win Rate (strict) |
|----------|--------------------|--------------------|
| Random (built-in) | **51%** | 31% |
| RandomAgent | **43%** | — |
| GreedyAgent | **53%** | — |

### What Works
1. **Training Pipeline** ✅
   - PPO agent trained to 1M timesteps with random opponent
   - Stable learning curve: -9.91 → +27.99 reward
   - Episode length: 2 → 30 steps

2. **Evaluation Pipeline** ✅
   - v3 evaluation uses Gym wrapper (same interface as training)
   - Fallback mode for invalid actions allows measuring strategic capability
   - Strict mode for measuring raw policy quality
   - Proper opponent integration via `choose_action()` API

3. **Model Quality** ✅
   - Beats GreedyAgent 53% (with fallback) — above random baseline
   - Scores 9-10 avg points (legitimate Splendor gameplay, near 15-point threshold)
   - Reaches 20-24 points in best games

4. **Code Quality** ✅
   - 24/24 unit tests passing
   - State vectorizer + Gym wrapper fully functional
   - Comprehensive debug tooling

### Known Limitations
1. **No action masking**: 40-60% of games have invalid actions → need `MaskablePPO`
2. **0 legal actions edge case**: ~20% of games affected by Splendor engine quirk
3. **Only trained vs random**: Performance vs structured opponents not optimized

## ❌ Phase 8: Experiment 1 — Greedy Opponent Training (COMPLETE — NEGATIVE RESULT)

**Date**: 2026-02-25 to 2026-02-26  
**Status**: ❌ Hypothesis REJECTED  
**Session**: 6-7  
**Report**: `project/experiments/reports/ppo_v2_greedy_opponent_report.md`

### Hypothesis
Training PPO with a stronger (Greedy) opponent — identical hyperparams and reward to v1 — yields
a policy that beats v1 in head-to-head play, proving that opponent strength matters for PPO training.

### Result: **HYPOTHESIS REJECTED**
V2 performed dramatically worse than V1 in all matchups. Training against a Greedy opponent without
Action Masking causes the agent to learn passive, avoidance behavior instead of winning strategies.

### Tasks
- [x] Analyzed original fork codebase: found `StateEvaluatorHeuristic` (5-weight formula), `alpaca` MCTS framework
- [x] Created v2 config: `project/configs/training/ppo_score_based_v2_greedy_opp.yaml`
- [x] Created v2 training script: `project/scripts/train_score_based_v2.py`
- [x] Created dev log: `dev_logs/2026-02-25_session6_greedy_opp_experiment.md`
- [x] Launched training: tmux session `train_v2`
- [x] Training complete: 1M steps, final reward -3.90 (never sustained positive)
- [x] Evaluated v2 vs all opponents (100 games each)
- [x] Generated TensorBoard plots and comparison charts
- [x] Documented results in report

### V2 Evaluation Results (100 games each, fallback mode)

| Opponent | V2 Win Rate | V1 Win Rate | V2 Agent Score | V1 Agent Score |
|----------|-------------|-------------|----------------|----------------|
| Random (wrapper) | **3.0%** | 51.0% | 1.9 ± 3.4 | 9.5 ± 7.6 |
| RandomAgent | **3.0%** | 43.0% | 3.1 ± 4.2 | 9.0 ± 7.1 |
| GreedyAgent | **7.0%** | 53.0% | 2.8 ± 4.7 | 10.1 ± 7.6 |
| Random (strict) | **2.0%** | 31.0% | 1.5 ± 3.2 | 5.2 ± 7.6 |

### Key Training Metrics Comparison

| Metric | V1 | V2 |
|--------|----|----|
| Final Reward | +27.99 | -3.90 |
| Peak Reward | +38.43 | +6.62 |
| Explained Variance | 0.541 | **-0.167** |
| Clip Fraction | 0.111 | **0.346** |
| Invalid Actions/Game | ~10+ | **0.03-0.11** |

### Key Insight
V2's one "success" — near-zero invalid actions — came at the cost of strategic capability.
The agent learned to pick safe (always-legal) actions like gem collection, but never learned
to buy cards or pursue victory points. **Action Masking is prerequisite before training
against harder opponents.**

### Success Criteria (All FAILED)
- ❌ v2 wins > 55% vs v1 → v2 wins 3-7% against all opponents
- ❌ v2 avg VP ≥ v1 against GreedyAgent → v2: 2.8 vs v1: 10.1
- ❌ Training converges: `ep_rew_mean > 0` by 500K → Never sustained positive

## 🔧 Technical Notes

### Environment
- **Platform**: WSL2 (Ubuntu 22.04)
- **Python**: 3.10.19
- **PyTorch**: 2.5.1+cu121
- **SB3**: 2.7.1
- **GPU**: RTX 4090 (25.76 GB, CUDA 12.1)

### Performance
- **State vectorization**: <1ms per call
- **Training speed**: ~520 FPS (CPU), ~1000+ FPS (GPU expected)
- **Validation results** (10k steps):
  - Episode survival: 1 → 24 steps (24x)
  - Mean reward: -10 → -6.37 (36% improvement)

### Known Issues
- SB3 warning about GPU utilization with MLP (expected, not critical)
- Legacy gym deprecation warnings (harmless, from old Splendor code)
- **RESOLVED**: `_opponent_move()` now uses `choose_action(observation, [])` API path
- **RESOLVED**: Evaluation scripts now use Gym wrapper
- **KNOWN**: No action masking → 40-60% of games have invalid actions
- **KNOWN**: ~20% of games hit 0 legal actions (engine edge case)

## 📝 Lessons Learned

1. **WSL2 > Windows** for ML workflows (10-20x I/O, native packages)
2. **Pip > Conda** for PyTorch on WSL2 (fewer conflicts)
3. **Quick validation tests** save time before long runs
4. **135-dim state** sufficient for score-based agent
5. **Test coverage** caught 4 bugs before training
6. **Always evaluate through the same interface as training** — evaluating outside the wrapper causes action space mismatch
7. **Debug with game traces** — running a single verbose game reveals bugs instantly
8. **Low scores (0-2 pts) in Splendor = agent not playing real game** — legitimate games reach 15+ points
9. **Legacy agent API: `choose_action()` not `choose_act()`** — `choose_action()` loads the observation into the agent's private env, `choose_act()` assumes it's already loaded
10. **Action masking is critical** — without it, Discrete(200) lets the model pick indices that exceed the number of legal actions
11. **Don't train against too-strong opponents without Action Masking** — the agent learns avoidance behavior (picking safe but useless actions) instead of winning strategies
12. **Negative explained variance = failed training** — V2's -0.167 means the value network is worse than a constant predictor
13. **Clip fraction > 0.3 is a warning sign** — V2's 0.346 suggests the learning rate is too aggressive for the problem difficulty

**Last Updated**: 2026-03-09 (Phase 10 concluded — V4a robust eval done: **75.8% vs Greedy, n=1000** [73.0%, 78.4%] CI; V4c 73% regression; stop-loss correctly triggered; pivot to Phase 11)  
**Next Steps**: Phase 11 — Event-based reward shaping. Design `event_reward_calculator.py`, add `reward_mode: event_based` to wrapper, train V5.
